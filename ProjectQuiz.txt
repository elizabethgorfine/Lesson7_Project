What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A CDN is a network that stores content on multiple servers that are placed in different regions. 
When a client wants content from the provider, they obtain the content from the nearest server to their current location.

Four advantages:
1. Pages load faster because a jQuery file doesnt have to be downloaded
2. Application runs well for every client because content is loaded from server that is closest to client rather than on one server for every single client.
3. Servers are always available, so websites are always available for users to access.
4. Scalability, new technology and advancements create larger demand but CDNs can handle it.
